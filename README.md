# Dicey-Dialogue

## Description
Dicey-Dialogue is a web application inspired by Medium, though our focus is centered
on the table top gaming community as a whole. The application allows users to create 
posts (tales), comment on the tales others have posted, follow other users who they
find interesting, and view their own personalized feed (lore) based on those they follow.
